To integrate your custom ORM seamlessly with Deno Deploy, consider the following
steps:

1. Ensure compatibility: Make sure your ORM is built using Deno-compatible APIs
   and doesn't rely on Node.js-specific features[1].

2. Use Deno-friendly database drivers: Opt for database drivers that work well
   with Deno, such as `postgres` for PostgreSQL or `sqlite` for SQLite[3].

3. Implement edge-friendly database connections: Since Deno Deploy runs at the
   edge, use connection pooling or serverless-friendly database connections[7].

4. Optimize for cold starts: Minimize initialization time by lazy-loading
   database connections and caching query results where appropriate[5].

5. Handle environment variables: Use Deno's built-in `Deno.env` to manage
   database credentials and other configuration settings[1].

6. Implement proper error handling: Ensure your ORM gracefully handles
   connection errors and retries, which are more common in serverless
   environments[5].

7. Use Deno Deploy's integration features: Leverage Deno Deploy's GitHub
   integration for easy deployment and automatic updates of your ORM[8].

8. Consider using JSR (JavaScript Registry) to publish your ORM, making it
   easily accessible for Deno projects[7].

9. Implement database migrations: Use a migration system compatible with Deno
   Deploy to manage schema changes[5].

10. Test thoroughly: Ensure your ORM works correctly in both local Deno runtime
    and Deno Deploy environments before deployment[7].

By following these steps, you can create a seamless integration between your
custom ORM and Deno Deploy, allowing for efficient serverless database
operations in your applications.
