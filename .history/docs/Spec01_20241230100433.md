- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and descriptive error messages.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design to allow plugins for additional database support or functionality.

=== Should-Have
- **Migrations**: Provide utilities for creating and applying schema migrations.
- **Custom Queries**: Allow execution of raw SQL queries when needed.
- **Validation**: Support validation rules for model properties.
- **Logging**: Provide query logging and debug utilities.
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for managing migrations and generating models.

=== Could-Have
- **Caching**: Simple caching for frequently queried data.
- **NoSQL Support**: Potentially include a way to support NoSQL databases in future extensions.


== Method

To build the custom ORM for Deno, we adopt a modular architecture that leverages TypeScript for type safety and ensures compatibility with multiple databases. The design emphasizes extensibility, ensuring new features and database integrations can be added seamlessly.

=== Architecture Overview

The ORM is divided into the following core modules:

1. **Database Connector**:
   - Manages low-level connectivity to databases.
   - Supports PostgreSQL and SQLite with adapters for each.
   - Includes connection pooling and transaction management.

2. **Model Layer**:
   - Provides APIs for defining and managing database models.
   - Enforces schema definitions using TypeScript interfaces.
   - Supports decorators for defining relationships and validations.

3. **Query Builder**:
   - Implements a fluent API for constructing SQL queries programmatically.
   - Supports nested queries and joins for advanced functionality.

4. **Migration System**:
   - Includes utilities for generating and applying schema migrations.
   - Provides a mechanism to track migration history in the database.

5. **Plugin System**:
   - Allows integration of new features or support for additional databases via plugins.

6. **CLI Tool**:
   - Offers commands for creating migrations, generating models, and debugging queries.

=== Technical Components

==== Database Connector

- Implements a factory pattern to initialize database connections based on user configuration.
- Example configuration object:
  ```typescript
  const config = {
    database: "postgres",
    user: "admin",
    password: "password",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
  };
  ```

==== Model Layer

- Models are defined as classes with decorators to map them to tables:
  ```typescript
  @Entity("users")
  class User {
    @PrimaryKey()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    name: string;

    @Column()
    email: string;

    @OneToMany(() => Post, (post) => post.user)
    posts: Post[];
  }
  ```

==== Query Builder

- Provides a chainable API for building queries:
  ```typescript
  const users = await queryBuilder
    .select("*")
    .from("users")
    .where("age", ">", 18)
    .execute();
  ```

==== Migrations

- Migrations are created via TypeScript files and stored in a `migrations` directory:
  ```typescript
  export default {
    up: async (db) => {
      await db.createTable("users", {
        id: "serial primary key",
        name: "varchar(255)",
        email: "varchar(255)",
      });
    },
    down: async (db) => {
      await db.dropTable("users");
    },
  };
  ```

==== Plugin System

- Plugins can extend the ORM's capabilities by registering new features:
  ```typescript
  import { ORM } from "./orm";
  ORM.registerPlugin(myCustomPlugin);
  ```

== Implementation

The implementation of Rex-ORM involves the following steps:

=== Step 1: Project Setup
1. **Initialize Deno Project**:
   - Create a new project directory and initialize it:
     ```bash
     mkdir rex-orm && cd rex-orm
     deno init
     ```
   - Add a `deps.ts` file to manage third-party dependencies (e.g., Denoâ€™s PostgreSQL driver):
     ```typescript
     export { Client as PostgresClient } from "https://deno.land/x/postgres/mod.ts";
     export { DB as SQLiteDB } from "https://deno.land/x/sqlite/mod.ts";
     ```

2. **Setup Testing Framework**:
   - Use Deno's built-in test framework and set up a test directory with example tests.

=== Step 2: Build the Database Connector
1. **Database Adapter Interface**:
   - Define a common interface for database adapters:
     ```typescript
     export interface DatabaseAdapter {
       connect(): Promise<void>;
       disconnect(): Promise<void>;
       execute(query: string, params?: any[]): Promise<any>;
     }
     ```

2. **PostgreSQL Adapter**:
   - Implement a PostgreSQL adapter:
     ```typescript
     import { PostgresClient } from "./deps.ts";
     import { DatabaseAdapter } from "./interfaces/DatabaseAdapter.ts";

     export class PostgresAdapter implements DatabaseAdapter {
       private client: PostgresClient;

       constructor(config: any) {
         this.client = new PostgresClient(config);
       }

       async connect() {
         await this.client.connect();
       }

       async disconnect() {
         await this.client.end();
       }

       async execute(query: string, params: any[] = []) {
         return this.client.queryArray(query, ...params);
       }
     }
     ```

3. **SQLite Adapter**:
   - Implement a similar adapter for SQLite.

=== Step 3: Model Layer
1. **Entity Decorators**:
   - Create decorators for defining models:
     ```typescript
     export function Entity(tableName: string) {
       return function (target: any) {
         target.tableName = tableName;
       };
     }

     export function Column() {
       return function (target: any, propertyKey: string) {
         if (!target.columns) target.columns = [];
         target.columns.push(propertyKey);
       };
     }
     ```

2. **Primary Key and Relationships**:
   - Add decorators for primary keys and relationships:
     ```typescript
     export function PrimaryKey() {
       return function (target: any, propertyKey: string) {
         target.primaryKey = propertyKey;
       };
     }
     ```

=== Step 4: Query Builder
1. **Chainable API**:
   - Implement a fluent API for constructing queries:
     ```typescript
     export class QueryBuilder {
       private query: string = "";

       select(columns: string) {
         this.query += `SELECT ${columns}`;
         return this;
       }

       from(table: string) {
         this.query += ` FROM ${table}`;
         return this;
       }

       where(column: string, operator: string, value: any) {
         this.query += ` WHERE ${column} ${operator} ${value}`;
         return this;
       }

       execute(adapter: DatabaseAdapter) {
         return adapter.execute(this.query);
       }
     }
     ```

=== Step 5: Migration System
1. **Migration Runner**:
   - Create a migration runner to apply and revert migrations:
     ```typescript
     export class MigrationRunner {
       constructor(private adapter: DatabaseAdapter) {}

       async run(migration: any) {
         await migration.up(this.adapter);
       }

       async rollback(migration: any) {
         await migration.down(this.adapter);
       }
     }
     ```

=== Step 6: CLI Tool
1. **Command Interface**:
   - Use Deno's CLI arguments API to handle commands for generating migrations and running them:
     ```typescript
     if (Deno.args[0] === "migrate") {
       // Run migrations
     } else if (Deno.args[0] === "generate:model") {
       // Generate model boilerplate
     }
     ```

=== Step 7: Testing and Documentation
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for each module to ensure reliability.
2. **Documentation**:
   - Provide usage examples and API documentation in Markdown format.
