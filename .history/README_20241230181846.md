## Features

- Fluent, chainable API for building queries
- Support for all basic CRUD operations

## Getting Started

Ensure you have Deno installed. `reflect_metadata` is included via import statements in the source code with a fixed version.

No additional installation is required as dependencies are managed through import URLs.

// SELECT Query with conditions
const users = await qb
  .select(["id", "name"])
